# Key IDs (`kid`)

When a verifier or decryptor spans several key versions, it needs a way to pick
the right one for an incoming JWS or ciphertext. That selector is the JWS/JWE
`kid` header. This crate derives the `kid` from a resource's **version
identifier** — the trailing segment of a Cloud KMS crypto key version resource
name or a Secret Manager secret version resource name (e.g. `"3"`) — and
[`VersionKid`](crate::kid::VersionKid) is the single vocabulary for that
derivation everywhere.

## Three choices

- [`VersionKid::none()`](crate::kid::VersionKid::none) — derive no `kid`. Keys
  carry no key ID unless one is supplied another way (for example, a `kid`
  already present on a JWK).
- [`VersionKid::verbatim()`](crate::kid::VersionKid::verbatim) — use the version
  identifier as-is, so version `"3"` becomes `kid` `"3"`.
- [`VersionKid::map`](crate::kid::VersionKid::map) — transform the version into
  a `kid`, e.g. `format!("my-key-v{version}")`.

```rust
use huskarl_google_cloud::kid::VersionKid;

let no_kid = VersionKid::none();
let version_as_kid = VersionKid::verbatim();
let prefixed = VersionKid::map(|version| format!("my-key-v{version}"));
# let _ = (no_kid, version_as_kid, prefixed);
```

## Why the two backends default differently

The choice of `kid` is the same everywhere; only the *default* differs, to match
each backend's convention:

- **Cloud KMS keys default to [`none()`](crate::kid::VersionKid::none).** A bare
  KMS version number (`"1"`, `"2"`, …) is rarely a useful `kid`, and KMS callers
  more often serve public keys as a JWKS whose entries already carry their own
  identifiers.
- **Secret Manager sources default to
  [`verbatim()`](crate::kid::VersionKid::verbatim).** A secret version is a
  natural, stable `kid` for rotation, so passing it through unchanged is usually
  what you want.

## How the `kid` is used for selection

The version-derived `kid` is a *fallback* identity, not an override. When the
secret material is itself a JWK document that carries its own `kid` (and `alg`),
those win — the version identity only fills in when the material has none. This
lets you store fully-formed JWKs and keep their intended key IDs, while opaque
key bytes still get a sensible `kid` from their version.

During rotation, a multi-key
[`MultiKeyVerifier`](huskarl_core::crypto::verifier::MultiKeyVerifier) or
[`MultiKeyDecryptor`](huskarl_core::crypto::cipher::MultiKeyDecryptor) matches
the incoming `kid` against each version's derived `kid` to route to the correct
key — which is why a stable, per-version `kid` matters. See
[key versions and rotation](crate::_docs::explanation::versions_and_rotation).
