# Reading secrets from Secret Manager

The `secretmanager` module turns a Google Cloud Secret Manager secret into a
[`huskarl` secret source](huskarl_core::secrets::Secret) — a lazily-fetched
value you can hand to any construct that consumes secret material. It comes in a
single-version form for ordinary secrets and a multi-version form for keys you
rotate.

## A single secret version

[`SecretVersionBytes`](crate::secretmanager::SecretVersionBytes) fetches one
version as raw bytes; [`SecretVersion::string`](crate::secretmanager::SecretVersion)
wraps it to decode the value as UTF-8 text (trimming surrounding whitespace).
Both fetch on every access — put caching in front if you need it. The
`resource_name` is a fully-qualified secret version name, and the `latest` alias
is accepted:

```rust,no_run
use google_cloud_secretmanager_v1::client::SecretManagerService;
use huskarl_core::secrets::Secret;
use huskarl_google_cloud::secretmanager::{SecretVersion, SecretVersionBytes};

# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let client = SecretManagerService::builder().build().await?;

// Raw bytes — no decoding applied.
let raw = SecretVersionBytes::builder()
    .client(client.clone())
    .resource_name("projects/p/secrets/my-secret/versions/latest")
    .build();
let bytes = raw.get_secret_value().await?;

// UTF-8 text.
let text = SecretVersion::string(
    SecretVersionBytes::builder()
        .client(client)
        .resource_name("projects/p/secrets/my-secret/versions/latest")
        .build(),
);
let value = text.get_secret_value().await?;
# let _ = (bytes, value);
# Ok(())
# }
```

Each fetched value carries an `identity` derived from its secret version via
[`VersionKid`](crate::kid::VersionKid), which becomes the `kid` when the value
feeds a signer or cipher. Secret Manager sources default to
[`verbatim()`](crate::kid::VersionKid::verbatim) — the version segment is used
as-is. See [key IDs](crate::_docs::explanation::key_ids).

## Rotating a key across versions

[`SecretVersions`](crate::secretmanager::SecretVersions) is the multi-version
handle: it exposes a **primary** version (via a caller-controlled alias you
repoint to promote a new key) and **all** enabled versions.
[`all`](crate::secretmanager::SecretVersions::all) returns both in one consistent
[`ActiveSecretVersions`](crate::secretmanager::ActiveSecretVersions) snapshot, in
which the primary is guaranteed to appear among the enabled set — so there is no
race between the encryption key and the set of decryptors.

Feed the primary to an encryptor and every enabled version to a
[`MultiKeyDecryptor`](huskarl_core::crypto::cipher::MultiKeyDecryptor). Here the
opaque key bytes become AES-GCM keys via a local `AesGcmKey` (from
`huskarl-crypto-native`), each keyed by its version:

```rust,no_run
use std::sync::Arc;

use google_cloud_secretmanager_v1::client::SecretManagerService;
use huskarl_core::crypto::cipher::{AeadDecryptor, MultiKeyDecryptor};
use huskarl_core::jwk::OctBytes;
use huskarl_core::secrets::Secret;
use huskarl_crypto_native::aead::AesGcmKey;
use huskarl_google_cloud::secretmanager::SecretVersions;

# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
let client = SecretManagerService::builder().build().await?;

let secret = SecretVersions::builder()
    .client(client)
    .secret_name("projects/p/secrets/my-aes-key")
    .primary_alias("active")
    .build();

// One snapshot: `primary` is confirmed present in `all`.
let active = secret.all().await?;

// Encrypt with the primary version — its `kid` is the secret version.
let encryptor =
    AesGcmKey::from_secret(active.primary.clone().mapped(OctBytes::new("A256GCM"))).await?;

// Decrypt across every enabled version, routed by `kid` during rotation.
let mut decryptors: Vec<Arc<dyn AeadDecryptor>> = Vec::new();
for version in &active.all {
    decryptors.push(Arc::new(
        AesGcmKey::from_secret(version.clone().mapped(OctBytes::new("A256GCM"))).await?,
    ));
}
let decryptor = MultiKeyDecryptor::new(decryptors);
# let _ = (encryptor, decryptor);
# Ok(())
# }
```

Rotate by adding a new version, waiting for every consumer to load it (they
reload their `all` set on refresh), then repointing the `active` alias — the same
add → wait → promote order as [KMS
rotation](crate::_docs::explanation::versions_and_rotation). Rebuild the snapshot
on a schedule with a
[`ScheduledRefreshCipher`](huskarl_core::crypto::cipher::ScheduledRefreshCipher);
[`all`](crate::secretmanager::SecretVersions::all) is the typical factory body.
See the [self-refreshing keys guide](crate::_docs::guide::refreshing_keys).

> If the stored value is itself a JWK document, its own `kid` and `alg` take
