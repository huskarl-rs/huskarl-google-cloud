//! Google Cloud KMS crypto integrations.

//! - [`asymmetric`] — JWS signing with EC/RSA/Ed25519 keys and JWKS serving.
//! - [`symmetric`] — AEAD encrypt/decrypt (`RAW_ENCRYPT_DECRYPT`) and HMAC
//!   signing/verification (`MAC`).
//! - [`version`] — the [`VersionStrategy`] that selects which key version to
//!   pin.
//!
//! Keys resolve their version(s) once, at build time, and pin the result;
//! signing and encryption pin a single version while verification and
//! decryption span all enabled versions. For the model and how to rotate
//! safely, see [key versions and
//! rotation](crate::_docs::explanation::versions_and_rotation); to rebuild keys
//! on a schedule, see the [self-refreshing keys
//! guide](crate::_docs::guide::refreshing_keys).
