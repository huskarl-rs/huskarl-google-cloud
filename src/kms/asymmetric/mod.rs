//! - [`signer`] — a [`SigningKey`] that signs JWS via Cloud KMS, pinning a
//!   version per [`VersionStrategy`](super::VersionStrategy).
//! - [`jwks`] — a [`Jwks`] provider that serves the key's public versions to
//!   verifiers.
//!
//! See [key versions and

//! and rotation model, and the [signing guide](crate::_docs::guide::asymmetric_signing).
